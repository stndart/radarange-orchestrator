       "### Key Components:\n",
       "1. **Scaling Factor**: \n",
       "   - `alpha = 2^(-semitones/12)` adjusts time scaling. Pitch shift by X semitones corresponds to frequency scaling of `2^(X/12)`, so time scaling is the inverse.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Windowing**:\n",
       "   - Uses a Hann window to reduce spectral leakage.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Phase Correction**:\n",
       "   - Computes phase differences between consecutive frames.\n",
       "   - Unwraps phase to avoid discontinuities.\n",
       "   - Scales phase increments by `alpha` to achieve pitch shift.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Overlap-Add Synthesis**:\n",
       "   - Reconstructs the signal using inverse FFT and overlap-add to maintain continuity.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Usage:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "# Example usage:\n",
       "import numpy as np\n",
       "from scipy.io import wavfile\n",
       "\n",
       "# Load your audio data (replace with your own)\n",
       "# sr, f = wavfile.read('input.wav')\n",
       "# f = f.astype(np.float64)  # Ensure float64\n",
       "# f /= np.max(np.abs(f))    # Normalize to 1\n",
       "\n",
       "# Pitch shift by +2 semitones (higher pitch)\n",
       "shifted_audio = pitch_shift(f, sr, semitones=2)\n",
       "\n",
       "# Save output (adjust as needed)\n",
       "# wavfile.write('output.wav', sr, shifted_audio)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Notes:\n",
       "- **Window Size**: Adjust `window_size` (e.g., 1024, 4096) for different time-frequency resolutions.\n",
       "- **Hop Length**: Controls overlap. Smaller values (e.g., `window_size//4`) improve quality but increase computation.\n",
       "- **Edge Cases**: The code may need padding for signals not perfectly aligned with window/hop sizes.\n",
       "- **Phase Unwrapping**: Basic unwrapping is used; for long signals, consider tracking phase over all frames for each bin.\n",
       "\n",
       "This implementation provides a foundational approach. For production use, consider:\n",
       "- Handling edge frames with zero-padding.\n",
       "- Using more robust phase unwrapping (e.g., tracking phase over all frames for each bin).\n",
       "- Optimizing with FFT libraries like `librosa` for efficiency."

But the download failed because of a DNS issue (\"Failed to resolve 'arxiv.org'\"). However, the pdf_read tool somehow still returned the content, which is a bit confusing. Maybe the download was successful in the second attempt or there was a cached version? \n",

       "Looking at the pdf_read response, it provided the content of the paper. The paper is about improving the phase vocoder technique for audio processing. The title is \"Phase Vocoder Done Right\" by Zdeněk Průša and Nicki Holighaus. The abstract mentions a new method for phase correction using phase gradient estimation and integration, which avoids common artifacts like transient smearing.\n",

Here's a brief walkthrough of the key points:\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Problem with Traditional Phase Vocoders**\n",
       "- **Phase Artifacts**: Classical phase vocoders often produce artifacts like transient smearing, \"echo,\" and \"phasiness\" due to poor handling of phase coherence. These issues arise because traditional methods neglect the **frequency-direction phase derivative**, focusing only on time-direction phase progression.\n",
       "- **Limitations**: Existing techniques (e.g., peak tracking, transient detection) require complex signal analysis and may fail for non-sinusoidal or transient-rich signals (e.g., percussive sounds).\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Proposed Solution**\n",
       "The authors propose a novel phase correction method based on:\n",
       "1. **Phase Gradient Estimation**:\n",
       "   - Compute both **time-direction** (∆ₜφ) and **frequency-direction** (∆ₙφ) partial derivatives of the STFT phase.\n",
       "   - Use centered finite differences for robust estimation of these gradients.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Real-Time Phase Gradient Heap Integration (RTPGHI)**:\n",
       "   - Integrates phase gradients adaptively using a **max-heap data structure** to prioritize processing high-magnitude spectral components first.\n",
       "   - Propagates phase in both time and frequency directions:\n",
       "     - **Time direction**: Uses trapezoidal integration of the time derivative (similar to classical PV).\n",
       "     - **Frequency direction**: Integrates the frequency derivative to maintain vertical phase coherence.\n",
       "   - No explicit transient detection or peak tracking is required.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Key Advantages**\n",
       "- **Automatic Phase Coherence**: Preserves both horizontal (time) and vertical (frequency) phase coherence without manual intervention.\n",
       "- **Robustness**: Handles non-sinusoidal signals, time-varying frequencies, and transients without artifacts.\n",
       "- **Simplicity**: Avoids complex signal analysis (e.g., transient detection) used in prior methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Evaluation**\n",
       "- **Setup**: Compared against state-of-the-art tools like **élastique PRO**, **IRCAM Lab**, and **Melodyne** using listening tests with diverse audio excerpts (violin/castanet, drum solos, orchestral music, etc.).\n",
       "- **Results**:\n",
       "  - The proposed method outperformed classical PV and matched or exceeded commercial tools for most test cases, especially at extreme time-scaling factors (e.g., α = 2).\n",
       "  - Listeners rated it as less \"phasy\" and better at preserving transient clarity compared to traditional methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Conclusion**\n",
       "The method achieves high-quality time-scaling by leveraging phase gradients and adaptive integration, eliminating the need for complex signal analysis. While it slightly lags behind specialized tools for monophonic speech, it is a competitive, general-purpose solution for polyphonic audio processing.\n",

       "Hmm, I need to explain these step by step. Let me start by understanding each part.\n",
       "\n",
       "Formula (9) seems to be the reconstruction of the time-scaled signal. The tilde over f indicates it's the estimated signal. The sum over n suggests it's combining contributions from each STFT frame. The term f̃_n(l - n a_s) probably represents the synthesis of each frame's contribution at time l, shifted by the synthesis step a_s.\n",
       "\n",
       "Formula (10) defines f̃_n(l), which is the synthesis of each frequency bin. The term g_s(l) is the synthesis window. The summation over m is the inverse STFT for each frame n, using the modified phase φ_s and magnitude s from the analysis. The exponential terms are the inverse Fourier transform components.\n",

       "Formula (11) gives the synthesis window g_s in terms of the analysis window g_a. The denominator involves a sum over all time shifts n of the squared analysis window shifted by n a_s.

       "Wait, the user might be confused about the role of each formula. They might want to know how these equations contribute to the overall time-scaling process. Let me break it down:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Formula (9)**: This is the overall signal reconstruction. Each frame n contributes to the output signal at time l. The synthesis step a_s determines how much each frame is shifted. If a_s > a_a (analysis step), the signal is stretched; if smaller, compressed.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Formula (10)**: For each frame n and time l, this computes the contribution of that frame to the output. The synthesis window g_s(l) modulates the inverse STFT of the modified STFT coefficients (s and φ_s). The exponential terms reconstruct the time-domain signal from the frequency bins.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Formula (11)**: The synthesis window is scaled by 1/M and normalized by the sum of squared analysis windows at each time shift. This normalization ensures that when windows overlap, their contributions add coherently, avoiding amplitude distortions.\n",

       "- g_s: synthesis window, derived from g_a\n",

       "The user might also be interested in why the synthesis window is defined that way. The denominator in (11) is the sum of squared windows at each possible shift, which accounts for the overlap-add process. This normalization is crucial for avoiding amplitude modulation artifacts.\n",
       "\n",
       "I should check if there are any potential misunderstandings. For instance, the user might confuse a_s and a_a, or not realize that the phase correction φ_s is what enables time scaling without artifacts. Also, the role of the window functions in STFT overlap-add is important here.\n",

       "Okay, the user wants to implement a phase vocoder for pitch shifting in Python. They mentioned they have the audio data loaded as a numpy array 'f', normalized to 1, and know the frame rate. The goal is to shift the pitch by X semitones in either direction. \n",
       "\n",
       "First, I need to recall how phase vocoders work. The basic idea is to modify the time-scale by adjusting the analysis and synthesis hop sizes. Since pitch shifting involves changing the frequency, which relates to time scaling (since pitch is inversely proportional to time), the approach would be to adjust the time scaling factor based on the semitone shift.\n",
       "\n",
       "The user wants to shift by X semitones. The formula for the time scaling factor (alpha) when shifting pitch is alpha = 2^(X/12). Because pitch shift by X semitones corresponds to a frequency scaling of 2^(X/12), so time scaling is the inverse (since time and frequency are inversely related in this context).\n",
       "\n",
       "Next, I need to outline the steps of the phase vocoder. The standard steps are:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **STFT Analysis**: Break the signal into overlapping frames, apply windowing, and compute the FFT.\n",
       "2. **Modify Phase**: Adjust the phase to account for the time scaling. This involves phase vocoder's phase correction step.\n",
       "3. **Overlap-Add Synthesis**: Reconstruct the signal using the modified STFT coefficients.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the user is referring to the article \"Phase Vocoder Done Right\", which uses a different phase correction method. However, since the user might not have access to the specific implementation details from the paper, I'll stick to a standard phase vocoder approach, noting that the article's method might have optimizations.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, the user mentioned the article's method uses phase gradient integration. But implementing that might be more complex. Since the user is asking for a basic implementation, maybe start with the standard phase vocoder and mention possible improvements.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, maybe the user expects the standard approach. Let me proceed with the standard phase vocoder steps, as the article's method might require more involved phase handling which could be too complex for a first implementation.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, steps for standard phase vocoder:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Choose parameters: window size (e.g., 2048), hop size (analysis and synthesis). The time scaling factor alpha is 2^(X/12). The synthesis hop size is analysis_hop * alpha. Since alpha can be fractional, need to handle that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but in practice, the phase vocoder uses overlapping frames and adjusts the phase incrementally. The key is to compute the instantaneous frequency and accumulate the phase.\n",

       "The standard approach involves:\n",
       "\n",
       "For each frame:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Compute the STFT of the current frame.\n",
       "2. Compute the phase difference between consecutive frames.\n",
       "3. Adjust the phase to account for the time scaling (alpha).\n",
       "4. Accumulate the phase over frames.\n",
       "5. Perform inverse STFT with the modified phases and overlap-add.\n",

       "\n",
       "To handle fractional hop sizes, interpolation between frames might be needed, but that complicates things. Alternatively, use a method that allows for non-integer scaling by adjusting the phase increments.\n",
       "\n",
       "Alternatively, use the standard approach where the phase is adjusted by the desired frequency shift. Since pitch shift is a frequency scaling, the phase increment per frame should be adjusted by the factor 2^(X/12).\n",
       "\n",

       "1. **Scaling Factor**: \n",
       "   - `alpha = 2^(-semitones/12)` adjusts time scaling. Pitch shift by X semitones corresponds to frequency scaling of `2^(X/12)`, so time scaling is the inverse.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Windowing**:\n",
       "   - Uses a Hann window to reduce spectral leakage.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Phase Correction**:\n",
       "   - Computes phase differences between consecutive frames.\n",
       "   - Unwraps phase to avoid discontinuities.\n",
       "   - Scales phase increments by `alpha` to achieve pitch shift.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Overlap-Add Synthesis**:\n",
       "   - Reconstructs the signal using inverse FFT and overlap-add to maintain continuity.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Usage:\n",
       "```python\n",
       "# Example usage:\n",
       "import numpy as np\n",
       "from scipy.io import wavfile\n",
       "\n",
       "# Load your audio data (replace with your own)\n",
       "# sr, f = wavfile.read('input.wav')\n",
       "# f = f.astype(np.float64)  # Ensure float64\n",
       "# f /= np.max(np.abs(f))    # Normalize to 1\n",
       "\n",
       "# Pitch shift by +2 semitones (higher pitch)\n",
       "shifted_audio = pitch_shift(f, sr, semitones=2)\n",
       "\n",
       "# Save output (adjust as needed)\n",
       "# wavfile.write('output.wav', sr, shifted_audio)\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "### Notes:\n",
       "- **Window Size**: Adjust `window_size` (e.g., 1024, 4096) for different time-frequency resolutions.\n",
       "- **Hop Length**: Controls overlap. Smaller values (e.g., `window_size//4`) improve quality but increase computation.\n",
       "- **Edge Cases**: The code may need padding for signals not perfectly aligned with window/hop sizes.\n",
       "- **Phase Unwrapping**: Basic unwrapping is used; for long signals, consider tracking phase over all frames for each bin.\n",
       "\n",
       "This implementation provides a foundational approach. For production use, consider:\n",
       "- Handling edge frames with zero-padding.\n",
       "- Using more robust phase unwrapping (e.g., tracking phase over all frames for each bin).\n",
       "- Optimizing with FFT libraries like `librosa` for efficiency.</div></body>"
