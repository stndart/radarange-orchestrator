       "\n",
       "The article by S. Drofa et al. titled **\"Bichromatic microwave manipulation of the NV center nuclear spin using transition not detectable via optically detected magnetic resonance\"** explores a novel method for manipulating nuclear spins in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond using **bichromatic microwave fields**. Here are the key findings and details beyond the abstract:\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Core Findings:**\n",
       "1. **Forbidden Transitions and Coherent Control:**\n",
       "   - The study demonstrates **coherent manipulation of nuclear spins** in NV centers using **forbidden magnetic transitions** (e.g., transitions between states \\( |m_S, m_I\\rangle \\) that are not directly detectable via conventional optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)).\n",
       "   - These transitions are \"invisible\" in ODMR spectra due to overlap with hyperfine interactions from carbon-13 (\\(^{13}\\text{C}\\)) isotopes but can be leveraged via **coherent population trapping (CPT)**.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Natural Diamond Feasibility:**\n",
       "   - The experiments were conducted on a diamond sample with **natural abundance of \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\)** (≈1.1%) and nitrogen concentration of 0.93 ppm, making the approach more practical and cost-effective compared to previous studies requiring **isotopically pure diamond** (which lacks \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\)).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Contrast Achieved:**\n",
       "   - **Apparent contrast** (reduction in fluorescence signal) of **98 ± 11%** was observed for CPT resonances.\n",
       "   - **True contrast** (relative to the baseline fluorescence without microwaves) was **35 ± 7%**, indicating significant suppression of spin transitions despite inhomogeneous broadening from \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Experimental Setup:**\n",
       "   - A **tilted magnetic field** (≈87.6° relative to the NV axis) was applied to enable forbidden transitions.\n",
       "   - A **Helmholtz resonant antenna** provided uniform microwave fields, and fluorescence was detected using a photodiode after filtering out excitation light.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Key Details Beyond the Abstract:**\n",
       "1. **Role of Forbidden Transitions:**\n",
       "   - Forbidden transitions (e.g., \\( |0, 0\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |-1, +1\\rangle \\)) were not directly visible in ODMR spectra due to overlap with \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) sidebands. However, CPT resonances were observed by applying **bichromatic microwaves** at calculated frequencies for these transitions.\n",
       "   - The CPT effect was achieved even without direct detection of the forbidden transitions, relying instead on **quantum interference** between allowed and forbidden pathways.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Challenges with \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) Broadening:**\n",
       "   - Hyperfine interactions with \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) nuclei caused **inhomogeneous broadening**, masking forbidden transitions in ODMR. However, CPT resonances remained detectable due to their narrow linewidths (~kHz), which were distinct from the broader \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\)-induced features.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Contrast Optimization:**\n",
       "   - Increasing microwave power improved contrast but introduced complications like **modulation of resonance wings** at frequencies matching the \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) Larmor precession (≈32–48 kHz for 30–45 G fields). This suggests interactions between nuclear spins and the microwave fields.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Practical Implications:**\n",
       "   - The method enables **RF-free nuclear spin control**, eliminating the need for bulky radiofrequency antennas. This is critical for miniaturizing sensors like **rotation gyroscopes** and **magnetic field detectors**.\n",
       "   - The use of natural diamond lowers costs, making the technology more viable for commercial applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Important Methodological Insights:**\n",
       "- **CPT Resonance Detection:**\n",
       "  - Two-dimensional scans of microwave frequencies (pump and probe) were used to locate CPT resonances (Fig. 4b in the paper).\n",
       "  - The contrast was maximized by optimizing pulse lengths, microwave power, and laser intensity.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Theoretical Model:**\n",
       "  - The Hamiltonian for the NV center included terms for electron and nuclear Zeeman effects, zero-field splitting, and hyperfine interactions. Calculations showed that forbidden transitions become accessible at **near-perpendicular magnetic fields** (≈89° tilt).\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### **Potential Follow-Up Questions:**\n",
       "1. **How does the tilted magnetic field enable forbidden transitions?**\n",
       "   - The tilt mixes electron and nuclear spin states, lifting degeneracies and allowing transitions that would otherwise be forbidden by selection rules.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Why is natural diamond viable despite \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) broadening?**\n",
       "   - CPT relies on quantum interference, which is less affected by broadening than direct ODMR detection. The narrow linewidth of CPT resonances (~kHz) distinguishes them from broader \\(^{13}\\text{C}\\) features.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **What are the limitations of this approach?**\n",
       "   - The true contrast (35%) is lower than ideal due to inhomogeneous broadening and technical noise. Scaling to higher sensitivity may require further optimization or hybrid approaches.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **How does this advance rotation sensing?**\n",
       "   - Nuclear spins in NV centers can act as gyroscopes. Eliminating RF fields simplifies integration into compact devices for applications like navigation or geophysical sensing.\n",

Recently, rotation sensors utilizing the nuclear spins of nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond have \\\\nbeen demonstrated. However, these devices are power-intensive and challenging to integrate into small chip-based \\\\nradiofrequency antennas and circuits necessary for controlling nuclear spins or producing relatively high magnetic \\\\nfields. To address this issue, the coherent manipulation of nuclear spins via coherent population trapping at moderate \\\\nmagnetic fields using microwave fields has been successfully demonstrated in isotopically pure diamond. In this work, \\\\nwe demonstrate that a similar technique can be applied to a diamond plate with a natural abundance of carbon-13, \\\\nwhich holds significant potential for practical sensing applications. Although the forbidden resonances required for \\\\ncoherent control were only partially observed, coherent population trapping was successfully demonstrated at both \\\\nvisible and invisible transitions, with an apparent contrast of up to 98 ± 11% and a true contrast of approximately 35 \\\\n± 7%. This finding confirms the feasibility of coherent nuclear spin control even in diamond plates with naturally \\\\noccurring carbon-13.\\\\nI. \\\\nINTRODUCTION \\\\nThe negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color \\\\ncenter in diamond has garnered significant attention \\\\nfor its use in sensing applications. It serves as a \\\\nsensitive element in various high-resolution magnetic \\\\nfield sensors [1–3], including scanning magnetic \\\\nmicroscopes [4–7], fiber-based sensors [8–10], wide-\\\\nfield magnetic microscopes [11], and detectors \\\\ncapable of sensing both DC and AC magnetic fields \\\\nwith high sensitivity [12–15]. Additionally, the NV \\\\ncenter can function as a local temperature sensor [16–\\\\n19], \\\\na \\\\nrotation \\\\nsensor [20–23], \\\\na \\\\nnear-field \\\\nfluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor [24], or \\\\neven as an oriented imaging agent [25,26]. In several \\\\nof these applications, the nearby nuclear spin of either \\\\nthe nitrogen atom or the carbon-13 isotope plays a \\\\ncritical role, serving as a quantum memory [16–18], an \\\\nancilla to enhance measurement fidelity [27], or as an \\\\nindependent \\\\nsensing \\\\nelement [22]. \\\\nHowever, \\\\nmanipulating the nuclear spin state typically requires \\\\nlow-frequency electromagnetic fields, on the order of \\\\none to ten MHz, which introduces the complexity of \\\\nadditional antennas to the experimental setup [22]. \\\\nIntegrating these antennas with those that generate \\\\nmicrowave fields for electron spin manipulation [28–\\\\n30] presents a challenge. These microwave fields must \\\\nprovide a high degree of uniformity for electron spin \\\\ncontrol while being compatible with dispersive spin-\\\\nstate readout methods [31]. Alternatively, a high \\\\nmagnetic \\\\nfield \\\\nof \\\\naround \\\\n510 G \\\\ncould \\\\nbe \\\\nemployed [22], but such fields are difficult to produce \\\\nwith minimal noise. As a result, there is a strong \\\\ndemand for developing methods that can control \\\\nnuclear spins without relying on radiofrequency fields. \\\\nRecently, all-microwave initialization and coherent \\\\nmanipulation of nuclear spins have been demonstrated \\\\nin isotopically pure diamond [32]. The key idea behind \\\\nthis approach is to apply a magnetic field that is \\\\nstrongly tilted relative to the NV axis, which causes \\\\nmixing of state configurations and enables forbidden \\\\ntransitions that simultaneously flip both electron and \\\\nnuclear \\\\nspins. \\\\nThese \\\\ntransitions \\\\nallow \\\\nthe \\\\nmanipulation of individual nuclear spins without the \\\\nneed for low-frequency fields. However, due to the \\\\nnature of these forbidden transitions, detecting them \\\\ncan be challenging—even with a tilted magnetic \\\\nfield—since they share the same frequency as \\\\nsidebands produced by hyperfine interactions with \\\\ncarbon-13 atoms. While the use of isotopically pure \\\\ndiamond can mitigate this issue, such material is \\\\nexpensive, making it less practical for widespread \\\\nsensing applications. \\\\nThe key idea of manipulation of the nuclear spin is the \\\\nuse of the so-called coherent population trapping, the \\\\ncoherent phenomena, appearing in 3-level \\uf04c systems \\\\nunder biochromatic radiation [33,34]. If each of the \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\nfields, composing the biochromatic field, is in \\\\nresonance with allowed transitions with a common \\\\nexited state, then one could expect absorption of both \\\\nfields, but instead, in the situation when the difference \\\\nof two fields \\uf064\\uf077 is equal to the energy difference \\\\nbetween the ground states of the \\uf04c – system \\uf044, due \\\\nto the quantum interference, the atomic system \\\\nbecomes transparent for both fields. This transmission \\\\nresonance is rather narrow [35–37], limited by the \\\\nwidth of the forbidden transition in the \\uf04c – systems \\\\nground state, and is usually defined by technical \\\\nlimitations [38–42]. In a specific case, when one of the \\\\nfields is strong and another one is weak, this \\\\nphenomenon is also known as electromagnetically \\\\ninduced transparence [43–48]. This phenomenon was \\\\nsuccessfully \\\\nused \\\\nfor \\\\nhigh-precision \\\\nmagnetometry [49], the development of compact \\\\nfrequency standards [50], quantum memories and \\\\nphoton control [51–58], and laser cooling below the \\\\nrecoil limit [59]. \\\\nIn this work, we demonstrate that the coherent \\\\nmanipulation of nuclear spins is still achievable \\\\nwithout directly detecting forbidden transitions when \\\\nusing diamond with a natural abundance of carbon. \\\\nWe show that despite the fact that optically detected \\\\nmagnetic resonance (ODMR) may not provide clear \\\\nevidence of resonance, coherent population trapping \\\\n(CPT) resonance can be observed with significant \\\\ncontrast. This is achieved by applying a biochromatic \\\\nmicrowave field at the calculated frequency of the \\\\nforbidden \\\\ntransition \\\\nand \\\\ndetecting \\\\nmagnetic \\\\nresonance. Thus, this paper paves the way for the \\\\ncoherent manipulation of nuclear spins in diamonds \\\\nwith natural carbon abundance, which are significantly \\\\nmore affordable than isotopically pure diamonds, by \\\\nutilizing \\\\ninvisible \\\\ntransitions \\\\nconcealed \\\\nby \\\\ninhomogeneous broadening. \\\\nII. \\\\nMETHODS \\\\nThe ground state on an NV center is a triplet state with \\\\nwell-defined components of the total electron spin \\\\nprojection \\\\n1\\\\nS =  along the NV center axis. There is \\\\nalso a hyperfine interaction between the electron spin \\\\nand the nuclear spin \\\\n1\\\\nI =  of nitrogen within the NV \\\\ncenter. Magnetic transitions from the ground state with \\\\nthe component of an electron spin along the NV center \\\\naxis \\\\n0\\\\nS\\\\nm =\\\\n to the state with \\\\n1\\\\nS\\\\nm = \\uf0b1 alter the \\\\nmagnetic moment by 1. As a result, one would expect \\\\nthat only transitions where the nuclear spin remains \\\\nunchanged are allowed \\\\n0\\\\nI\\\\nm\\\\n\\uf044\\\\n=\\\\n. However, when an \\\\nexternal magnetic field is applied nearly perpendicular \\\\nto the NV axis, the configuration of states is altered, as \\\\nillustrated in Fig. 1a, enabling previously forbidden \\\\ntransitions [32]. For simplicity, we will refer to nuclear \\\\nstates by their dominant component. Transitions \\\\npermitted by this dominant component are termed \\\\n“allowed” and the rest “forbidden”, in accordance with \\\\nthe basis where the quantization axis is aligned with \\\\nthe NV axis. \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\nFig. 1.

(d) – Pulse sequences for ODMR and CPT experiments. \\\\nFig. 1b illustrates the idea of the experimental setup. \\\\nAll measurements are performed with an ensemble of \\\\nNV centers. The sample is a diamond plate with [111] \\\\ncut, natural concentration of \\\\n13C , and 52 ppb \\\\nconcentration of nitrogen. The sample was grown by \\\\nthe high-pressure high-temperature method. The \\\\nsample was then irradiated by an electron beam with \\\\nan energy of 3 MeV and a dose of irradiation of \\\\n16\\\\n2\\\\n8 10 cm−\\\\n\\uf0d7\\\\n. Then it was annealed at 800 С\\\\n\\uf0b0\\\\n for 2 \\\\nhours [60]. \\\\nThe microwave field is provided using a Helmholtz \\\\nresonant antenna [60], connected to a quadrature \\\\nmodulator on a Stanford Research Systems SG384 \\\\ngenerator through two amplifiers with a total gain of \\\\n63 dB. The gain of the generator is set to \\\\n32.5 dB\\\\n−\\\\n \\\\nunless otherwise specified.  \\\\nEmission of the ensemble of NV centers is filtered \\\\nfrom the excitation 520 nm light (Wavespectrum \\\\nWSLD-520-001-K) with a long-pass 650 nm filter, \\\\ncollected by a truncated cylinder concentrator, and \\\\nthen is detected using a PDB-C609 Advanced \\\\nPhotonix photodiode with a custom amplifier.  \\\\nUsing the described setup, magnetic transitions in the \\\\nNV center ground state are probed using pulses in the \\\\nODMR experiment, with the pulse sequence shown in \\\\nFig. 1d. The resulting spectrum is presented in Fig. 1c. \\\\nFor all ODMR spectra, we subtracted the fluorescence \\\\nsignal acquired after probing the MW pulse (“signal”, \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\nFig. 1d) from the fluorescence intensity signal, taken \\\\nprior to the MW field pulse (“ref”, Fig. 1d), thus \\\\nsuppressing the fluctuations of laser intensity and \\\\nremoving the offset of large NV signal fluorescence. \\\\nNotably, this procedure also inverts the sign of the \\\\nODMR resonance, which typically appears as a dip in \\\\nthe bright fluorescence signal. \\\\nThe measured ODMR spectra (e.g. Fig. 1 (c)) not only \\\\ndisplay the NV magnetic resonance triplets but also \\\\ninclude sidebands, which arise due to hyperfine \\\\ninteractions with 13C  nuclear spins. To account for \\\\nthese features, spectra are fitted using a model, where \\\\nfor each NV magnetic resonance triplet, a sum of nine \\\\nLorentzians is utilized. Three Lorentzians correspond \\\\nto the main part of the triplet and six Lorentzians \\\\nrepresent the sidebands. These sidebands result from \\\\ninteractions with two groups of 13C  atoms. 13C  \\\\nappearing in the first group of 6 possible atomic sites \\\\nnear vacancy contributes to 13.7 MHz hyperfine \\\\nsplitting, while the second group, comprising 3 \\\\npossible \\\\npositions, \\\\nproduces \\\\na \\\\n12.8 MHz \\\\nsplitting [61]. To simplify the model, the average \\\\nhyperfine splitting parameter of \\\\n13.4 MHz\\\\n\\uf044=\\\\n was \\\\nused.

The control over the nuclear \\\\nspin via CPT also known as electromagnetically \\\\ninduced transparency resonance requires a 3-level \\\\nlambda system. Several such systems are possible \\\\nwithin the NV ground state (Fig. 1a), but all of them \\\\ninvolve forbidden transitions.  \\\\nIII. \\\\nRESULTS \\\\nTo locate forbidden transitions in the spectra, one \\\\nneeds to determine the shift of energy levels in the \\\\npresence of an external magnetic field, which is \\\\nrequired to allow forbidden transitions, but also to \\\\nisolate the preferred orientation of an NV center. \\\\nCalculation of these shifts using a simple model with \\\\nHamiltonian: \\\\n \\\\n2\\\\n2\\\\nˆ\\\\nˆ\\\\nˆ\\\\nˆ\\\\nˆ\\\\nˆ\\\\nz\\\\ne\\\\nz\\\\nn\\\\nH\\\\nDS\\\\nQI\\\\nA\\\\n\\uf067\\\\n\\uf067\\\\n=\\\\n+\\\\n\\uf0d7\\\\n+\\\\n−\\\\n\\uf0d7\\\\n+\\\\n\\uf0d7\\\\n\\uf0d7\\\\nS B\\\\nI B\\\\nS\\\\nI   (2) \\\\nis presented in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b.

The operators ˆS  and ˆI  \\\\nare vector operators for electron and nuclear spins, \\\\nrespectively. It can be observed that allowed \\\\ntransitions with isotope shift almost always overlap \\\\nforbidden transitions at small tilt angles (see Fig. 2a). \\\\nFor near-perpendicular tilt angles, though, they do not \\\\noverlap as long as allowed transitions experience \\\\nminor splitting. However, the strength of all transitions \\\\ndecreases at a 90° angle, so balance should be \\\\nmaintained. Small forbidden transition probability \\\\nleads to higher requirements for microwave power to \\\\nobserve the same ODMR contrast or smaller ODMR \\\\ncontrast if the power is maintained the same. Thus, to \\\\ndetect c  transition, the external field for the \\\\nobservation of forbidden transitions on ODMR is tilted \\\\nat about 89–89.9° relative to the NV-center axis, where \\\\nlines, corresponding at 0 magnetic field to c transition \\\\nand “\\\\n13\\\\n3,\\\\nC ” (which is transition “ 3 ” for level \\\\n1\\\\ns\\\\nm = +  shifted by the presence of 13C  nearby), are \\\\nsplitting (see Fig. 2b). \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\n \\\\nFig. 2.

The contribution of 13C  within the two-level model is presented in a green dot-dashed line, while \\\\nforbidden transitions (degenerate c, d) are marked in red long and short dashed lines. The amplitude of the ODMR \\\\npeaks was normalized to unity. (d) Rabi oscillations for the forbidden transition c (Blue) with a generator set to -\\\\n30 dBm. For comparison, there are Rabi oscillations for strong transition 3 (orange dashed line). The scale of the \\\\nallowed amplitude of transition oscillations to forbidden transition oscillations is 10 to 1, while oscillations were \\\\nobserved under the same microwave conditions. The amplitude of the signal is normalized to unity with the \\\\nequilibrium signal level being taken as 0. \\\\nOnce the position of the transitions in the given field \\\\nis identified, one can compare calculations with the \\\\nODMR spectrum (see Fig. 2c, Table 1). Only one of \\\\nthe forbidden resonances could be detected, namely \\\\nthe “c-d” resonance (see Fig. 1a). This transition could \\\\nbe driven with a microwave field, as shown in Fig. 2d. \\\\nIt is evident that the transition is driven considerably \\\\nslower than the allowed transition “3”, and shows a \\\\ntrace of off-resonance Rabi oscillations from nearby \\\\nallowed transitions due to significant microwave \\\\npower.  \\\\nTransition \\\\nFrequency, MHz \\\\n1- \\\\n2869.1 \\\\n2- \\\\n2871.1 \\\\n3 \\\\n2874.9 \\\\n2 \\\\n2876.3 \\\\n1 \\\\n2878.3 \\\\nc-d \\\\n2881.3 \\\\nTable 1. Transition frequencies of the NV center in a \\\\nnear-perpendicular magnetic field \\\\nWe note here that the angle of the magnetic field of \\\\n89.5° with respect to the 111 axis was used to detect \\\\nthe transition, but it is not ideal for further \\\\nexperiments, since at this angle, ODMR triplet \\\\nresonances are not fully resolved, and populations of \\\\ndifferent hyperfine levels are mixed. To maintain \\\\ndistinct triplet resonances and adhere to the traditional \\\\nODMR framework, while still allowing the forbidden \\\\ntransitions to remain weakly allowed, we reduced the \\\\nangle of the magnetic field to 87.6° with respect to the \\\\n111 axis in subsequent experiments. \\\\nTransition “c” can form a 3-level “V” system with \\\\ntransition “1”, as shown in Fig. 3a, and a 3-level “Λ” \\\\nsystem with transition “ 2 ”, while transitions “a” and \\\\n“b” form a similar 3-level “Λ” system with transitions \\\\n“1” and “3 ”, respectively. \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\n \\\\nFig. 3. (a) – Ground state of the NV center in a “perpendicular” magnetic field. Thick color lines indicate the V-\\\\nsystems associated with “c”, “d” transitions. (b) CPT resonance for pump pulse set to “3” transition, the probe pulse \\\\nwas scanned in frequency. (c) ODMR in comparison to CPT. – Pump pulse is set to forbidden transition “c”, the probe \\\\nis scanned in frequency. (d) The detailed spectrum of transition 2 in the presence of radiation at transition “c”.  \\\\nTo observe the CPT signal, one of the microwave \\\\nfields, specifically the pump pulse, was set to \\\\ntransition “3”, and the second microwave field, probe \\\\npulse, was scanned in frequency around the frequency \\\\nof nearly degenerate transitions “d” and “c”. The \\\\nfluorescence signal was detected during the probe \\\\npulse, and the collection time was set to 130 μs to \\\\nmaximize the signal-to-noise ratio. As one can see in \\\\nFig. 3b, there is significant suppression of one of the \\\\nnitrogen nuclear spin related resonances with the \\\\nnuclear spin \\\\n1\\\\nI\\\\nm = −. This is likely caused by partial \\\\noptical pumping from the states \\\\n1\\\\nI\\\\nm = −, \\\\n0\\\\nI\\\\nm =\\\\n to \\\\n1\\\\nI\\\\nm = +  by microwave radiation permanently tuned \\\\nto transition “3”. While transition “2” is not in direct \\\\nresonance with MW radiation, its wing is still excited, \\\\nand therefore we expect that over a long time, the \\\\npopulation will be mostly collected on \\\\n1\\\\nI\\\\nm = +  state. \\\\nMoreover, on top of transition “d” itself, one can see a \\\\nweak narrow dip in the ODMR signal. If one instead \\\\nuses a pump pulse centered at transition “d” and \\\\nobserves transition “3” with a probe pulse, then the \\\\nCPT resonance is much easier to see on top of the \\\\nstrong transitions “2” and “3” (see Fig. 3c). The \\\\nstrongest of the resonances, corresponding to the \\\\ntransition “2”, is demonstrated in Fig. 3d in more \\\\ndetail. The resonance clearly has some modulation of \\\\nits slopes, which will be discussed below. The dip at \\\\nresonance “2” cannot be explained by the “V” scheme, \\\\npresented in Fig. 3a, and corresponds to the \\uf04c \\\\nscheme, presented in Fig. 4a. The \\uf04c scheme indeed \\\\ntends to have a much bigger contrast most likely due \\\\nto the fact that \\\\n1\\\\nS\\\\nm = − as a result of interaction with \\\\ngreen light (see Fig. 1d) has a significant chance to \\\\ndecay at \\\\n0\\\\nS\\\\nm =\\\\n thus losing nuclear spin coherence, \\\\nwhile \\\\n0\\\\nS\\\\nm =\\\\n only couples to the excited state and \\\\nthus its coherence is less disturbed.  \\\\nWhile only one transition is visible in the spectrum, \\\\none can identify the positions of the rest using the \\\\ncalculations, presented in Fig. 2a. If one sets one of the \\\\nmicrowave fields to the calculated frequency of \\\\ntransition “a” and the other on the frequency of strong \\\\ntransition “3”, then the \\uf04cresonance with invisible \\\\ntransition must be observed. The precise location of \\\\nthe transition may be detected by the CPT resonance \\\\nitself. To reveal the position of the CPT peak, we use \\\\na 2D scan plot with both “pump” and “probe” \\\\nmicrowave radiation frequencies scanned (Fig. 4b) \\\\nand thus allow the precise location of the resonance.  \\\\nAs shown in Fig. 4c, the resonance is almost as strong \\\\nas for transition “d” despite the fact that transition was \\\\nnot detected in the ODMR spectrum. It is interesting \\\\nto note that for the case of resonance related to the “d” \\\\ntransition, both \\uf04cschemes of transition “2” in pair \\\\nwith “c” and in pair with “d” are observed at the same \\\\nfrequency. Thus, contrasts of both “a”-related and “d”-\\\\nrelated CPT resonances are comparable. \\\\nOne can ask how CPT resonances have more or less \\\\nthe same contrast, despite transitions themselves being \\\\nso weak that they cannot be directly observed. The \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\nexplanation can be provided as follows: it is true that \\\\nfor both “a” and “d” resonances, the microwave \\\\nintensity and dipole moment of transitions are similar \\\\nand therefore have similar contrast Rabi frequencies of \\\\ntransitions “a” and “d”. Here, CPT resonances are \\\\nassumed to be far from saturation. Nevertheless, it is \\\\nnot necessary to contradict the fact that the resonance \\\\nwas not observed. The fact that transitions “a” and “b” \\\\nare not observed at the ODMR spectrum may be \\\\nexplained because they are very close to the strong \\\\ntransitions 2 and 3, both with the isotopic shift of 13C \\\\nin the nearest node, which is due to their relatively \\\\nlarge width in natural diamond.  \\\\n \\\\nFig. 4.

(b) Two-dimensional scan of ODMR in the presence \\\\nof two microwave fields. (c) Comparison of CPT resonances with pump pulse set to “a” (blue) and “c” (orange) \\\\ntransitions. (d) – Comparison of ODMR resonance and ODMR resonance with the CPT dip associated with “c” \\\\ntransition.  \\\\nThe contrast of CPT resonance could be improved if \\\\nlarger microwave radiation power is used. Fig. 5a \\\\nillustrates the rise of the contrast with the power of \\\\nmicrowave radiation when both microwave fields \\\\nwere rising at the same time. We should note that the \\\\ncontrast in the case of CPT resonance is loosely \\\\ndefined here. The naïve definition of “apparent \\\\ncontrast” \\\\nap\\\\nC  would be just to compare the amplitude \\\\n(\\\\n)\\\\nODMR\\\\nr\\\\nA\\\\nf\\\\n of ODMR resonance with one MW field \\\\nto the level of the CPT resonance minimum with \\\\nrespect to non-disturbed ODMR resonance \\\\n(\\\\n)\\\\nr\\\\nEIT f\\\\nA\\\\n as \\\\nindicated in Fig. 4d. Thus, the apparent contrast is \\\\ndefined as: \\\\n \\\\n(\\\\n)\\\\n(\\\\n)\\\\nr\\\\nEIT f\\\\nap\\\\nODMR\\\\nr\\\\nA\\\\nC\\\\nA\\\\nf\\\\n=\\\\n  \\\\n(3) \\\\nNevertheless, it may also be useful to compare the low \\\\nlevel of ODMR resonance to the level without MW at \\\\nall. As demonstrated in Fig. 5a, the formation of \\\\nODMR resonance is a dip in fluorescence, which is \\\\ninduced by the transfer of part of the population from \\\\n0\\\\ns\\\\nm =\\\\n state to \\\\n1\\\\ns\\\\nm =\\\\n state. Thus, if NV does not \\\\nabsorb MW radiation at all, like it should if all the \\\\npopulation is in the CPT state, then the emission of the \\\\nNV center should be maximal and equal to the NV \\\\nemission without microwave radiation. However, due \\\\nto the fact that ODMR resonance is always a dip in the \\\\nemission, if we add one “pump” microwave field, the \\\\nemission of NV should drop already, thus creating a \\\\nnew base level for ODMR resonance. On top of this, \\\\nin the ensemble of NV centers, there should be many \\\\nnon-homogenous contributions to the ODMR and \\\\nCPT resonances, respectively, but the position of CPT \\\\nresonances as long should be the same as the ground \\\\nstate has no inhomogeneous broadening [63,64]. Thus, \\\\nthe CPT dip should add up from all inhomogeneous \\\\ncontributions and in principle go to the level of NV \\\\nemission with no MW. In this sense, the apparent \\\\ncontrast should actually be over 100%. The true \\\\ncontrast should be defined as (see Fig. 5b):  \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\n \\\\n(\\\\n)\\\\n(\\\\n)\\\\nr\\\\nEIT f\\\\nODMR\\\\nr\\\\nA\\\\nC\\\\nA\\\\nf\\\\nA\\\\n=\\\\n+ \\uf044\\\\n \\\\n(4) \\\\nand is considerably smaller than the apparent contrast \\\\nin our experiments. In this formula, \\\\nrf  is the \\\\nfrequency of the CPT fringe, \\\\n( )\\\\nEIT\\\\nA\\\\nf\\\\n is the profile of \\\\nODMR under pump and probe pulses, and \\\\n( )\\\\nODMR\\\\nA\\\\nf\\\\n \\\\nis the profile of classic ODMR. Here we used \\\\nmax\\\\nEIT\\\\nA\\\\n for contrast estimation, because precise \\\\nmeasurement of ODMR is obstructed by background \\\\nchange due to probe pulse and pulse length being not \\\\nequal to π-pulse.  \\\\nThere are two important features of the CPT resonance \\\\nat large microwave power: first, it is apparent that \\\\nresonance has some structure, which on one side has \\\\nsplitting at the center of the resonance, on another \\\\nperiodic modulation of the resonance wings (Fig. 6). \\\\nThe period of modulation of the resonance wings does \\\\ndepend on the magnetic field but does not depend on \\\\nmicrowave power. It is interesting that the frequency \\\\nof these oscillations is very close to the frequency of \\\\nLarmor \\\\nprecession \\\\nof \\\\nthe \\\\ncarbon-13 \\\\nnuclei \\\\nsurrounding the NV center, which for the magnetic \\\\nfield B  is [65]. \\\\n \\\\n(\\\\n)\\\\n13\\\\n2\\\\n535 Hz/G\\\\nC\\\\nN\\\\ng\\\\nB\\\\nB\\\\n\\uf06d\\\\n\\uf077\\\\n\\uf070\\\\n=\\\\n=\\\\n\\uf0d7\\\\n. \\\\n (5) \\\\nAccording to this formula, the frequency for a \\\\nmagnetic field of 30 G is 32 kHz and for 45 G is \\\\n48 kHz, which is close to the experimentally found \\\\nvalues: 30 kHz and 45 kHz, respectively. The physical \\\\npicture behind this correspondence remains to be \\\\ndiscovered. Resonance modulation for bichromatic \\\\nNV center excitation was previously studied in the \\\\nwork [66].\\\\n \\\\nFig. 5. (a) – Schematic illustration of the formation of ODMR resonance under 1 (blue) and 2 (orange) MW fields. \\\\nOrange lines also illustrate inhomogeneous broadening. (b) – Same as Fig. 4d but with the use of only the first \\\\nreference (see Fig. 1d right) for both CPT and single MW ODMR resonance.  \\\\nThe splitting of the resonance center was not carefully \\\\ninvestigated due to its small value compared to the \\\\nother features. It is most likely caused by the excitation \\\\nof both “c” and “d” transitions, as the applied \\\\nmicrowave field to “c” and “d” transitions \\\\ncorresponded to a Rabi frequency of about 60 kHz \\\\nwhile splitting between levels 0, 1\\\\n+\\\\n and 0, 1\\\\n−\\\\n at 45 \\\\nG is an order of 10 kHz. \\\\n \\\\nFig. 6. Zoom of CPT resonance associated with the “a” \\\\ntransition for two magnetic fields: 30 G (blue) and \\\\n45 G (orange).  \\\\nAfter the optimization of the MW pulse length, \\\\nmicrowave power, and green laser power, as well as \\\\nthe optimization of the ratio of amplitudes of the pump \\\\nto probe pulses, an apparent contrast of 98±11% for \\\\nresonance associated with transitions “c” and “d” was \\\\nachieved (see Fig. 4d). Nevertheless, the true contrast \\\\nin this case is only 35 ±7%.  \\\\nIV. \\\\nCONCLUSION \\\\nA diamond sample with a natural abundance of \\\\ncarbon-13 and 0.93 ppm of nitrogen was investigated \\\\nunder bichromatic microwave radiation in the \\\\npresence of laser pumping. In magnetic fields, nearly \\\\nperpendicular to the axes of NV centers selected for \\\\ninvestigation, CPT resonances on V and \\uf04c systems \\\\ninvolving forbidden transitions were observed despite \\\\nthe fact that forbidden resonances were not observed \\\\nin the ODMR resonances. The power dependence of \\\\nresonances contrast was investigated and found to be \\\\nlinear within available MW powers. The resonances \\\\nwere found to be modulated by amplitude. The \\\\nmodulation frequency depends on the magnetic field \\\\nand was in good correspondence with the precession \\\\nfrequency of the carbon-13 spins. Furthermore, the \\\\ncontrast of CPT transition was optimized reaching an \\\\n*Contact author: a.akimov@rqc.ru \\\\napparent contrast of 98 ± 11% and a true contrast of \\\\n35 ± 7%, paving the way for purely microwave field \\\\ncontrol of nuclear spins in NV centers and radio-\\\\nfrequency free rotation sensors.  \\\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS  \\\\nThis research was supported by a grant from the \\\\nMinistry of Science and Higher Education of the \\\\nRussian Federation No. 075-15-2024-556.  \\\\n \\\\n[1] \\\\nJ.
