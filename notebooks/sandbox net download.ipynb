Setting scrape_pages to true will get more details, but maybe start with max_results=10 to get a good spread.\n",

       "Looking at the search results, the first result titled \"Manipulation of the NV center nuclear spin using invisible transition\" from arXiv (href: 2410.06658) seems relevant. The body mentions nuclear spin manipulation, which matches the user's description. Another result from 2024 (2410.06658v2) also talks about nuclear spin and microwave manipulation, which could be the same paper. The user mentioned EIT/CPT, and the fifth result mentions CPT/EIT in NV centers, but the author isn't specified. Since the user mentioned S. Drofa, I should check if any of these papers list them as an author. However, the provided search results don't show the authors, only titles and abstracts. That's a problem. Maybe the initial search didn't include \"S. Drofa\" effectively. Perhaps the query needs adjustment to include the author's name more explicitly, like \"Drofa NV centers EIT arxiv\".\n",

       "Wait, the user might have made a typo or the author's full name might be different. Alternatively, maybe the paper is recent, so the arXiv ID 2410.06658 is from October 2024, which fits if it's recent. Since the user's colleague is S. Drofa, perhaps that's the author of the first result. Without more info, I'll proceed with the most relevant link. The href for the first result is the arXiv abstract page. To get the PDF, the direct link would be arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06658.pdf. \n",
