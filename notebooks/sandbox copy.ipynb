Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, using a recursive approach where each triangle is split into three smaller ones.\n",

Maybe Sierpiński is better. Let me recall the algorithm for the Sierpiński triangle. One method is to generate rows where each row's length doubles each time, but that might complicate the code. Alternatively, using a size of 2^n -1 rows. Let's say we go for a height of 32 lines (so 2^5 -1 is 31, which is under 20, but maybe 2^6 is 63 rows which is over.
